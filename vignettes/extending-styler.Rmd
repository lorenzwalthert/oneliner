This package shows you how you can extend styler by writing a package that 
exports style guides like the one showcased in this package: The 
`one_line_style`. styler only implements one style guide (the tidyverse style 
guide). People who want to distribute their own style guides can follow the 
instructions in this vignette.

## Organisation

There are various files that should be the same for all third-party style guides.

* R/rules.R contains the rules of the style guide. Alternatively, it can be 
  split up like styler into `rules-[kind]`, where `kind` is the category
  the rules belong to (such as `rules-spacesR`, compare styler).
* R/styler-io.R contains all infrastrucure re-exports from styler.
